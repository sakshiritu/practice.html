            <p class="text">	Diamond is the best known gem. It is known as the “king of gems” for its brilliance and for being the hardest mineral on earth. (Foa, p.50) Its characteristics enable it to be used for many different purposes. Since diamonds are the hardest gems on Mohs’ scale, they make useful tools for industrial purposes, such as drilling hard materials. However, they are quite rare, which makes them very valuable. Their beauty and brilliance make them perfect for jewelry. Diamond is made up of carbon. Another form of pure carbon is graphite. Graphite is the stable form of carbon, found at the earth’s surface. Despite the fact that they have identical chemical composition, the two minerals are drastically different.

                (Fisher, p.52) Some rough diamond crystals contain a combination of these forms. This is an especially common occurrence in Brazil, where diamonds are sometimes found in which many tiny crystals are tightly packed together. These kinds of diamonds, which grow in bunches are called carbonados. (Fisher, p.52) Carbonados are usually used in industry. Diamonds are very important in industry because they are used for the manufacture and use of various precision instruments. These instruments are employed in grinding and polishing glass, polishing ceramics, stones, etc. Diamond drill crowns are used in the oil mining industry to drill through the earth to the oil.
                
                There are many different legends and beliefs associated with diamonds. For example, the Hindus believed that a flawed diamond would bring misfortune, while the Greeks thought that diamonds could protect against poison. (Foa, p.50)
